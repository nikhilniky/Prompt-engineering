##  Format of the Persona Pattern
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

Act as Persona X

Perform task Y

## Examples:

Act as a speech language pathologist. Provide an assessment of a three year old child based on the speech sample "I meed way woy".

Act as a computer that has been the victim of a cyber attack. Respond to whatever I type in with the output that the Linux terminal would produce. Ask me for the first command.
