  -> In chatbot or Large language model we certainly do not get the same output when we give the same input multiple times 
  -> We can use like time specific things like from now on last two inputs like this etc to make it clear and make our inputs refined 
  
  Using keywords or specific phrasing in your questions can help guide the model and get more accurate and relevant responses. 
  By providing clear and concise instructions, you can improve the chances of receiving the information you need. Here are some tips to make your questions more effective:
  
  Be Specific: Include specirds or phrases related to your topic of interest.
  For example, instead of asking "Tell me about Prompt Engineering," you could ask "What are the key concepts of Prompt Engineering?"
  
  Use Action Verbs: Frame your questions with action verbs to prompt the model to provide actionable information. 
  For instance, instead of asking "Can you explain Prompt Engineering?" you could ask "Explain the process of Prompt Engineering."
  
  Provide Context: Give a brief context or background to help the model understand the context of your question. 
  For example, instead of asking "What are the best programming languages?" you could ask "In the context of web development, what are the best programming languages?"
  
  Ask for Examples: If you want illustrative examples, specifically request them in your question. 
  For instance, instead of asking "What is a neural network?" you could ask "Can you provide an example of a neural network?"
  
  Use Bullet Points or Lists: When asking for a list of items or steps, use bullet points or numbered lists to make it clear to the model. 
  For example, instead of asking "How do I improve my productivity?" you could ask "List five tips to improve productivity."
  
  Specify Length or Format: If you want a concise answer or a specific format (e.g., definition, pros and cons), mention it explicitly. 
  For example, instead of asking "What do you think of AI?" you could ask "Briefly explain the pros and cons of AI."
  
  I prompted: how LinkedIn my LinkedIn profile
  ChatGPT
  To receive a tailored response, it would be helpful to include some specific keywords or phrases in your question. Here's a suggestion to make your question more specific:
  
  Original question: "How to improve my LinkedIn profile."
  
  Better version: "What are some effective tips to enhance my LinkedIn profile and attract more attention from potential employers?"
  
  Would you like to use the better version, or do you prefer to stick with your original question? Let me know your preference, and I'll be happy to provide guidance on improving your LinkedIn profile!


-=====================
we can have prompts at the same time like now, at the moment, and span of time also
 It's going to continue to influence the output of the large language model. So it is we can have immediate 
prompts that right now, right at this moment, do something, but we can also have prompts that span time. 
And in this case, that's what we're doing. We're creating something from now on go and do this. Now, we're going to have an immediate prompt, which is what color is the sky?
We're asking this right now and now our earlier prompt that we provided that was spanning time is impacting how the large language model responds to our questions.

we can run large language models in local
However, there have been efforts to develop more efficient and smaller versions of language models that can be used locally on less powerful devices.
For example, OpenAI has released smaller versions of GPT, such as GPT-2 and GPT-Neo, which are more manageable in terms of resource requirements and can be run on local machines.

Using a language model locally typically involves setting up the required software, libraries, and dependencies, as well as downloading the
model weights. While smaller models can be run on a reasonably powerful computer, the latest and larger models like GPT-3 would likely still 
require significant computational resources and might be more suitable for cloud-based deployment.

It's important to note that advancements in technology and model optimization could change the landscape in the future, 
making it more feasible to use larger language models locally. However, it's always a trade-off between model size, performance, and the resources available on the target machine.

If you are running local we are good with our information compared to using chatgpt like online or server-connected models
